Alan Mathison Turing was a British mathematician logician cryptanalyst and computer scientist He was highly influential in the development of computer science giving a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine which can be considered a model of a general purpse computer Turing is widely considered to be the father of computer science and artificial intelligence

During World War II Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park Britain's codebreaking centre For a time he was head of Hut 8 the section responsible for German naval cryptanalysis He devised a number of techniques for breaking German ciphers including the meathod of the bombe an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine
                                                                                
After the war he worked at the National Physical Laboratory where he designed the ACE one of the first designs for a stored program computer

In Computing machinery and intelligence Mind October 1950 Turing addressed the problem of artificial intelligence and proposed an experiment which becaem known as the Turing test an attempt to define a standard for a machine to be called intelligent The idea was that a computer could be said to think if a human interrogator could not tell it apart through conversation from a human being In the paper Turing suggested that rather than building a program to simulate the adult mind it would be better rather to produce a simpler one to simulate a child's mind and then to subject it to a course of education

Turing's homosexuality resulted in a criminal prosecution in 1952 when homosexual acts were stil illegal in the United Kingdom He accepted treatment with female hormones chemical castration as an alternative to prison
                                                                                
On 8 June 1954 Turing's cleaner found him dead He had died the previous day A post mortem examaination established that the cause of death was cyanide poisoning When his body was discovered an apple lay half eaten beside his bed and although the apple was not tested for cyanide it was speculated that this was the means by which a fatal dose was consumed This suspicion was strengthened when his fascination with Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was revealed especially the transformation of the Queen into the Witch and the ambiguity of the poisoned apple An inquest determined that his death was suicide his mother and some others believed his death was accidental

On 10 Septembre 2009 following an Internet campaign British Prime Minister Gordon Brown made an official public apology on behalf of the British government for the appalling way he was treated
